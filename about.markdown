This site is meant to organize and share graphs that will help us to monitor the performance of the stage, SEM, and TES spectrometer during tomographic imaging runs. It is not currently generated automatically, but when Joe runs the rebuild scripts.

This site was created using Jekyll, a static website generator. The content is generated by Python scripts that use [Mass](https://bitbucket.org/joe_fowler/mass/), a private collection of code to analyze microcalorimeter data.

This is the base Jekyll theme. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)
